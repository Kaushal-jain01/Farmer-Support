                               <strong>Coffee requires an average temperature of 15℃ to 28℃ . Growth of the coffee plants is very rapid during the hot rainy season and during the cool dry season the berries get ripened and ready to be plucked. Bright sunshine and warm weather are necessary for harvesting.</strong>

                               <strong>Prepare the site by digging a hole that is twice as wide and deep as the root ball. Check the drainage by filling the hole with water and watching how fast it drains. Mango trees can survive some periods of flooding, but the healthiest plants are produced where soils percolate well. Plant the young tree with the graft scar just at the soil surface. You don’t need to prune the young plant, but watch for suckers from the graft and prune them off. Young mango tree care must include frequent watering as the plant establishes. Mango trees grow easily from seed. Get a fresh mango pit and slit the hard husk. Remove the seed inside and plant it in seed starter mix in a large pot. Situating the seed with ¼-inch (.6 cm.) protruding above the soil surface works best for growing mango trees. Keep the soil evenly moist and place the pot where temperatures remain at least 70 F. (21 C.). Sprouting may occur as early as eight to 14 days, but may take up to three weeks. Keep in mind that your new mango tree seedling will not produce fruit for at least six years.</strong>
