The leaves are alternately arranged, simple oval with an acute tip and serrated margin, slightly downy below, 5-12 cm long and 3-6 cm broad on a 2-5 cm petiole. The flowers are produced in spring with the leaves, white, usually tinged pink at first, 2.5-3.5 cm diameter, with five petals.

        "planting": "The planting distance varies according to variety and the fertility level of the soil. The main consideration in planting trees is planting of sufficient pollinators to ensure effective pollination. Usually one pollinator tree is needed for two to three large trees planted at 10 m distance or one row pollinator for two rows of main cultivar. For high density planting the pollinator tree is planted after every sixth tree in a row. The most widely used planting system is the square system. In this system, the pollinators are planted after every sixth or ninth tree. The other popular system of planting is the rectangular system. In hilly areas the apple orchards are established by planting the trees on the contours so as to prevent soil erosion and reduce run off. The average number of plants in an area of one ha. can range between 200 to 1250. Four different categories of planting density are followed viz. low (less than 250 plants/ha.), moderate (250-500 plants/ha.), high (500-1250 plants/ha.) and ultra high density (more than 1250 plants /ha.). The combination of rootstock and scion variety determines the plant spacing and planting density/unit area.",

When they are cooked, kidney beans taste slightly sweet with a tender and grainy texture. Kidney beans contain nutrients like folate, magnesium, potassium, protein, and fiber. They are often used in chili, dips, as well as Indian, Middle Eastern, Central American, and Caribbean cuisines.",
        "climate" : "Kidney beans are planted at the very beginning of spring—after the last frost of winter has passed—as they grow best in warm temperatures. When you start growing your beans, the air temperature should be around 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and the soil temperature should be at least 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "planting" : "Purchase kidney bean seeds to plant in the ground. Rather than transplanting the plants, you want to grow them from seedlings. Bush beans and pole beans sprout from the same kinds of seeds. Choose a sunny spot in your garden. Pick a spot in your garden that gets plenty of direct sunlight, unobstructed by other plants or shaded areas. Kidney beans will need at least six hours of full sun a day for proper growth. Prepare your soil. You want to have loose, well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0 because the beans don’t respond well to high levels of moisture. Kidney beans generate their own nitrogen, so you won’t need to use mulch. Choose your support. Two common methods of growing kidney beans are in a planter or in the ground. If you’re planting your seeds in the ground, you may want to use a trellis or pole to support your plant as it grows vertically. If you’re not planting in your garden, you can use a planter to cultivate a small bean bush. Dig your holes. If you’re planting pole beans, create a series of one-to-two-inch deep holes, spacing them about four to six inches apart. If you’re planting bush beans, plant your seeds at least six inches apart, also at a depth of one-to-two-inches. If you’re cultivating a small bush in a planter, dig a single one-to-two inch hole in the middle of your planter. Direct sow your seeds. Like green beans and black beans, kidney beans have shallow roots, so it’s best to sow them directly into your soil rather than starting them in containers and transplanting them later. Water your bean seeds. Water your bean seeds whenever the soil around your plant appears dry. Overwatering can lead your seeds to rot. If you’re planting bush beans, water the seed immediately after you plant it. The germination process should begin in about 10 to 14 days. Protect your beans. Protect your bean plants from weeds by pulling them out by hand. You can also surround the plant with a small circle of mulch to protect weeds from growing into it. Check for pests like aphids, slugs, and leafhoppers often, and use organic fungicides if faced with powdery mildew or bean rust.",

Young trees are likely to suffer severe damage any time temperatures drop below 30 degrees, even if only briefly.",
        "planting" : "Prepare the site by digging a hole that is twice as wide and deep as the root ball. Check the drainage by filling the hole with water and watching how fast it drains. Mango trees can survive some periods of flooding, but the healthiest plants are produced where soils percolate well. Plant the young tree with the graft scar just at the soil surface. You don’t need to prune the young plant, but watch for suckers from the graft and prune them off. Young mango tree care must include frequent watering as the plant establishes. Mango trees grow easily from seed. Get a fresh mango pit and slit the hard husk. Remove the seed inside and plant it in seed starter mix in a large pot. Situating the seed with ¼-inch (.6 cm.) protruding above the soil surface works best for growing mango trees. Keep the soil evenly moist and place the pot where temperatures remain at least 70 F. (21 C.). Sprouting may occur as early as eight to 14 days, but may take up to three weeks. Keep in mind that your new mango tree seedling will not produce fruit for at least six years.",

This method is practised in those areas which are comparatively dry and less fertile and do not have much labour to work in the fields. It is the easiest method requiring minimum input but its yields are also minimum. In ploughing method, ploughing of land and sowing of seeds is done by two persons. This method is mostly confined to peninsular India. In transplantation method, eeds are sown in nursery and seedlings are prepared. After 4-5 weeks the seedlings are uprooted and planted in the field which has already been prepared for the purpose. The entire process is done by hand.",

        "name" : "Papaya",
        "scientificName" : "Carica papaya",
        "description" : "The papaya plant is considered a tree, though its palmlike trunk, up to 8 metres (26 feet) tall, is not as woody as the designation generally implies. The plant is crowned by deeply lobed leaves, sometimes 60 cm (2 feet) across, borne on hollow petioles (leaf stalks) 60 cm long. Normally, the species is dioecious, male and female flowers being produced on separate plants, but hermaphroditic forms are known, and numerous irregularities in the distribution of the sexes are common. Male flowers are borne in clusters on stalks 90 cm long; the flowers are funnel-shaped, about 2.5 mm (0.1 inch) long, and whitish, with 10 stamens in the throat. The female flowers are considerably larger, on very short stalks, and often solitary in the leaf axils; they have five fleshy petals that are united toward the base and a large cylindrical or globose superior ovary that is crowned by five fan-shaped sessile stigmas.",
        "climate" : "Papaya thrives best under warm, humid conditions. It is generally intolerant of strong winds and cold weather. Temperatures just below freezing can kill small plants to the ground–larger plants that are not killed outright will normally produce suckers to regenerate the plant and bear fruit within a year.",
        "planting" : "Papayas are usually grown from seed. Their development is rapid, with fruit being produced before the end of the first year. Under favourable conditions, a plant may live five years or more. The papaya ringspot virus nearly wiped out papaya crops around the world, first hitting Hawaiian plantations in the 1940s and soon spreading. A genetically modified (GMO) variety named the Rainbow papaya was developed in the early 2000s with resistance to the virus. It was one of the first GMO fruits in commercial production, and the majority of exported papayas are now GMO crops.",
